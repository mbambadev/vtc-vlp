We have python install and database next the last peace.

Run vtcvlp app
**************



Open vtcvlp directory inside your console like this:
::

    C:\Users\personal\ cd vtcvlp

If our first time to run app, we need to add requirements library

To do it we must run command

Open vtcvlp directory inside your console like this:
::

    C:\Users\personal\ pip install -r requirements.txt


Secondly we need to populate our database for do it

Run command ``python manage.py migrate`` like this:
::

    C:\Users\personal\vtcvlp\ python manage.py migrate

Finally

Run command ``python manage.py runserver`` like this:
::

    C:\Users\personal\vtcvlp\ python manage.py runserver

Now to use app we browse it with every browser inside it, in url place we set:

``localhost:8000``

Now we can use it.
