Once the registration form is correctly filled in go to your console and select the generated registration confirmation link because remember you are on a server running locally.

Now that you are connected, click on the three vertical buttons on your right you will have a modal window then finally indicate the name of your link and its address, finally click on the save button.
Now you have just recorded your first video link.
That's all you have to do
